   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

The HamCalc Port Project
===================================

This is a project to convert HamCalc from GW-Basic
to other, more universally useful languages.

See http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/cq_ham_calc/cq_ham_calc.html

One initial focus is to convert HamCalc to Python.
Other languages can certainly be supported.

As the project grows and expands, perhaps some elements of the
legacy HamCalc will be discareded and new features added.
