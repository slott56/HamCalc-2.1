graphs -- Graphs
-----------------

This is a generic :math:`y = f(x)` graphing program.

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a simple bit of Turtle Graphics to draw axes and
plot an equation.

There's no "calculation" module for this.
It's simply an application.

See :ref:`stdio.graphs`.

Legacy Quirks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The original program allowed you to edit a few lines
of the application itself to define the function.
