satorbit -- Satellite Orbit Parameters
----------------------------------------

Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~

The core issue here is to map orbital minutes to altitude.
Given minutes, *m*, we can compute a *z* factor and the
altitude, *h*.

..  math::

    Y = \left(\frac{144}{88}\right)^{1/16}

    z = \frac{\log m - \log 88}{\log Y} + 1

Where R is the radius of the earth, 3963.34 miles.

-   Altitude.  :math:`h = 100z`

-   radio horizon.

    ..  math::

        C = 2 \pi R

        X = \frac{R}{R+h}

        MR = \frac{\arccos X}{2 \pi} \times C

-   Apex angle of signal cone. :math:`2(90-\arccos X)`.

-   Diameter of area covered by signal cone. :math:`2 \times MR`.

-   Period. Input value, :math:`M`.

-   orbital speed. :math:`\frac{2 \pi (R+h)}{M}` miles per minute.

-   signal time. :math:`\frac{2h}{c}` where :math:`c` is the speed
    of light, here given as :math:`186 \times 10^3` miles per second.

-   Doppler shift. :math:`\frac{\lvert u-d \rvert}{20}`.

Legacy Output

Some of these outputs are not correct; what's relevant is the format.

Legacy Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different from the introduction seen in so many HamCalc programs,
this program has "notes" at the end.

::

         The calculations used in this program were interpolated from
         graphs appearing on page 111 of the Electronics Data Book
         publication No. 27 of the ARRL. The results of these calculations
         are sufficiently accurate for fast reference purposes but may not
         be suitable for very accurate satellite tracking.

Legacy Quirks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The calculation involves a set of approximations in a ``B`` array.

..  math::

    H = 144, L = 88, R_i = 100

    Y = \left(\frac{H}{L}\right)^{1/16}

For Y, the comment is "HI & LO 1600 miles apart on 100 mi.increment graph".

..  math::

    B_{z,1} = h_z = \lbrace R + R_i \times z \vert 1 \leq z < 21 \rbrace

    B_{z,2} = t_z = \left\lbrace \left(\frac{L}{Y}\right)Y^z \vert 1 \leq z < 21 \right\rbrace

    \left(\frac{L}{Y}\right)Y^z = LY^{z-1}

    B_{z,3} =  \lbrace h_z/t_z  \vert 1 \leq z < 21  \rbrace

The calculation of the altitude is :math:`h = J_6 \times M - R`, where :math:`J_6` is an interpolated value between :math:`B_{z,3} = h_z/t_z` and
:math:`B_{z-1,3} = h_{z-1}/t_{z-1}`.

It's not clear why the ``B`` array of values are computed in advance at
discrete intervals and then interpolated.
