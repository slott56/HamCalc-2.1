This is about preserving the amazing piece of recreational programming called HamCalc.

HamCalc is a wonderful, huge, sprawling collection of
GW Basic Code. Users must download a :file:`GWBASIC.EXE` to experience HamCalc.
But outside the Windows world, this is challenging at best, and impossible under
most typical use cases.

HamCalc has 449 individual program files and 85,431 lines of
interesting, useful knowledge encoded in GW-Basic.

See http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/cq_ham_calc/cq_ham_calc.html

The HamCalc project seeks to preserve the nuggets of goodness that are embodied in HamCalc.

Of the 449 programs, some may have significant bugs. Some may not even work properly.

The intent of collecting lots of common algorithms is noble and important.

We think that this should be continued, and the project forked into newer and more useful programming languages.

Additionally, we think that the programming should be elevated to the state of the art with respect to architecture and quality assurance. This means documentation and unit test cases.

It means uncoupling the user experience from the calculations themselves.
This allows a base library to support a number of presentations.
