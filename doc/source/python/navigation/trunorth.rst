This program appears to evaluate a version of the Equation of Time.

    20 :REM'Ref. ARRL ANTENNA BOOK, 14th Edition, page 16-2

We have 36 "wobble correction factors" that apply throughout the year.
Each factor belongs to the 1st, 11th or 21st of each month.

::

    160 :REM'.....wobble correction factors
    170 DATA  4,8,11,  13,14,14,  13,10,8,  4,1,-1,       -3,-4,-4,     -3,-1,1
    180 DATA  4,5,6,   6,5,3,     1,-3,-7,  -10,-13,-15,  -16,-16,-14,  -11,-7,-2

These are loaded into array, *C*, with three related fields.

-   *C* (*Z*, 1) is month: 1-12.

-   *C* (*Z*, 2) is day of month: 1, 11 or 21.

-   *C* (*Z*, 3) is the wobble correction factor for this month and day.
    This appears to be in minutes.

The following approximations are used for time offsets.

::

    600 TIM=DEG/15          :REM'time in hours to centre of time zone
    610 SN=TIM+12

Here's the code to compute the LST of noon on a given date using the
"wobble correction factors".

::

    720 N=SN+C(Z,3)/60:IF N>=1160 THEN N=N+40
    730 IF N<0 THEN N=N+24
    740 T=INT(N)*100+(N-INT(N))*60
    750 T=INT(T+0.5!):T$=RIGHT$(STR$(T),LEN(STR$(T))-1)
    760 IF LEN (T$)<4 THEN T$="0"+T$:GOTO 760
    770 LST=T+UTC*100:IF LST>=2400 THEN LST=T-1200
    780 PRINT TAB(6)M$(C(Z,1));USING "###";C(Z,2);
    790 PRINT " @ ";T$;" UTC (";LST;"LST )";

-   **720**.  *N* is UTC offset + 12 + wobble correction factor/60. Presumably in hours.

    If N >= 1160 clause doesn't make a lot of sense: SN is in the range 0 to 24.
    the correction factors are plus or minus 0.26

-   **730**.  *N* = *N* mod 24.

-   **740-760**.  Convert to *N* to *T*, an HH:MM number and *T$* the string
    version of *T*.

-   **770**.  LST is T+UTC offset converted to an HH:MM number.

Alternative
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following, *D* is the date, in days starting at zero on January 1.

..  math::

    W &= 360/365.24 \\
    A &= W \times (D+10) \\
    B &= A+(360/\pi) \times 0.0167 \times \sin(W \times (D-2)) = A + 1.914 \times \sin( W \times (D-2) ) \\
    C &= ( A - \arctan \frac{\tan B}{\cos 23.44} ) /180 \\
    EoT &= 720 \times (C - \lfloor C + \frac{1}{2} \rfloor)

Here's the note on the sign.

    In this article, and others in English Wikipedia, a positive value of the equation of time implies that a sundial is ahead of a clock.

This works for any day of the year.  The tabulated values above belong to 36
dates spaced about ``365.24/36=10.1455`` days apart.

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Equation of Time function can be added to the solar module.

See :mod:`hamcalc.navigation.solar`.

Here's the Python code to reconstruct the "Wobble Correction Factors" with
the more conventional sign.

::

    def eot(d):
        W = 360/365.24
        A = W*(d+10)
        B = A +1.914*(math.sin(math.radians(W*(d-2))))
        C = (A-math.degrees(math.atan2(math.tan(math.radians(B)),math.cos(math.radians(23.44)))))/180
        return 720*(C-int(C+.5))

Introduction

::

    TRUE NORTH via the Sun                                  by George Murphy VE3ERP

         The shadow of a vertically plumb stake cast by the sun at High
       Noon runs exactly north and south. This ancient axiom can be used to
       aim your antenna, orient a sundial, or calibrate your car compass.
         If the stake is north of lat. 23.5째N the shadow points north, if
       south of lat. 23.5째S, it points south. If the stake is between
       these latitudes and above the Equator the shadow points north in
       the winter and south in the summer. If south of the Equator it
       points north in the summer and south in the winter.
         To determine just when High Noon is, you must know your longitude.
       This will tell you when High Noon is SUPPOSED to occur but doesn't,
       due to the somewhat complex wobbling of the earth about its axis as
       it circles the sun. Ancient mathematicians didn't know much about
       the wobble but we do, so we have to take it into account, which the
       program does.
         The program refers to High Noon as SOLAR NOON (it sounds more
       High Tech). Local SOLAR (geophysical) TIMES shown may not be the
       same as STANDARD (political) TIMES in some political jurisdictions,
       and are dependent on your distance east or west of longitude 0.00째
       or the nearest multiple of 15 degrees of longitude.
