    The word "pipe" as distinguished from "tube"
    is used to apply to tubular products of
    dimensions commonly used for pipelines and
    piping systems. Pipe outside diameters are
    larger than corresponding nominal sizes
    whereas outside diameters of tubes (except
    copper) are identical to nominal sizes.

    The size of all pipe is identified by the
    nominal pipe size, and is based on a standard
    outside diameter. This OD was originally
    selected so that pipe with a standard OD and
    having a wall thickness typical of the period
    would have an inside diameter approximately
    equal to the nominal size. Although there is
    now no such relation between existing standard
    wall thicknesses, OD's and nominal sizes
    these nominal sizes and OD's continue in use
    as "standard".

    - Copper Tubing
    Copper tubing (commonly sold as "pipe" in hardware and building supply stores)
    is available in four types and hard (rigid) or soft (flexible) tempers:

    Type L, standard plumbing. Type L Hard is available in most hardware stores.

    Type K, thick walled, used for all underground applications.

    Type M, thin walled, for heating and pressure lines. Not made in some sizes.

    Type DWV (Drain, Waste and Vent). Hard only.  Not made in some some sizes.
