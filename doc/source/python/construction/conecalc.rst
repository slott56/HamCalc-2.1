conecalc -- Cone Calculator
-----------------------------

From the introduction:

    This program computes pattern sheet size and layout for any size
    cone and/or the cone and the pattern dimensions to fit any size
    pattern sheet.

    Dimensions can be any unit of measure as long as all dimensions
    are entered in the same units; x and y dimensions are measured from
    the lower left corner of the pattern sheet.

There are three use cases:

-   To compute cone pattern layout

-   To compute cone size to fit a known pattern sheet size

-   To compute truncated cone pattern layout
