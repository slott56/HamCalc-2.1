Preface
=======

This calculator helps design simple antennas with some consideration
for end-effects.

The performance of any antenna depends upon many factors, not the least of
which is its design. This program will help you arrive at a mathematically
precise design, but the overall performance of any antenna also depends upon
construction integrity, location, height, orientation, terrain, surrounding
objects, etc. Some antenna adjustment and pruning to compensate for these
variable conditions is nearly always required.

Antenna Design
==============

To compute antenna size for a wire antenna

1.  Enter the wire AWG # or diameter.

2.  Enter the desired center frequency or wavelength
