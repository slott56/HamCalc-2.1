Disclaimer and Apology
======================

Origins
-------

This is a shameless rip-off of George Murphy's (VE3ERP) fabulous
`HamCalc <ftp://ftp.qrz.com/pub/arrl/hamcal95.zip>`_ v. 9.4.
Get the original if you want to see some nifty DOS-Basic programming.
Lacking a full-time DOS machine, I've been forced to convert a tiny fraction
of his massive collection. I originally built Excel spread-sheets, but
they lack the polish of an application program. I found that Java worked
much better, and also permits web publishing.

The original works wonderfully in Metric or American units. I haven't
attempted to make this program capable of arbitrary units on display. This
is strictly in American units.

Compatibility
-------------

There are two major, known compatibility issues.

-   AOL. The AOL web browser doesn't understand Java. If the pages don't
    have calculators on them, your browser doesn't understand Java. You'll
    have to either get the original HamCalc or get a better browser.

-   Internet Explorer 4.0. The IE 4.0 browser's Java is not standard, and
    doesn't seem to work correctly. Also, IE 4.0 cannot be uninstalled, and has made
    irrevocable changes to your Windows 95 system. Sorry.
    Additionally, you may suffer
    kernal32.dll crashes,
    games that use DirectX 5 may stop working,
    Windows 95 may freeze up when the channel screen saver is used,
    you may not be able to use certain video cards in true color mode,
    you may have problems with Microsoft Outlook 97,
    you may lose profiles in Outlook and Exchange.

Fine Print: This software has no warranty of fitness for
any purpose whatsoever. If it doesn't seem to "work", I may be
sorry, but I am not liable in any form. I will do my best to make such
repairs as I see fit.

Notes
=====

This is built with a Java applet based on my own Model class. A Model
represents a mathematical model and includes fields which represent variables
of that model. A Model can compute any one field given values in one or
more other fields. Each field is dependent on zero or more other fields.
A field which depends on zero other fields must be entered can cannot be
computed. Other fields will be computed as data is entered.

As an example, consider the RTD model: rate*time = distance. We can
solve for either of the other two: r=d/t and t=d/r. The model knows all
three formulae and picks one based on the order of the user's of inputs.

As a usability note, Java does not recognize TAB as a significant GUI
action. It's just another character. Return or Enter are GUI actions. I
could (and perhaps will) change this in the future. For now, you must click
on the field, enter the data, and either hit return or click on another
field to see the calculation. Also, your JVM may not handle color changes
correctly.

As you enter values for fields, the model checks all other fields to
see if they can be computed from the fields available. Fields you enter
are marked in <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">blue</FONT>, fields it computes for
you are marked in <FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">magenta</FONT>.

Generally, the model uses a least-recently-used algorithm to determine
what is computable. If you enter rate and time, it computes distance. If
you change either rate or time, it recomputes distance. If you change distance,
it recomputes whatever you entered earliest.

For example, enter rate, enter time, get distance; change distance.
Since rate is least recent, it will be computed from time and distance.
The colors will change to reflect this.

Some web pages have multiple models. When there are two (or more) models
in the same panel, fields with identical names will be copied down the
panel from a model to the model below. You can change these in subsequent
models, but the change will *not* ripple back up the panel to prior
models.

Some models are fairly complex, and have several variables with complex
relationships. An example is the air coil design. A typical scenario for
coil design proceeds as follows.

1.  Use the AWG-Diameter-Turns-per-Inch model to choose your wire. Adjust
    the TPI or the diameter to allow for enamelled wire (0.005&quot; insulation).
    If using insulated wire, wrap a ruler, measure and enter turns per inch.

2.  Enter the inductance (in &micro;H's) for the coil. The form computes
    an ideal coil diameter and number of turns.

#.  Adjust the coil diameter for materials on hand.

#.  Adjust the number of turns to be an integer -- the inductance and length/diameter
    ratio will be recomputed to show you how your actual coil will match the
    ideal coil.

Note this common problem: If you do not change the coil diameter, the
recomputation of iductance will not be completed. Manual entry of both
coil diameter and number of turns (as well as TPI) is required to compute
inductance. The computed (in <FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">magenta</FONT>) value
is not sufficient, you must enter a value to make the field turn <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">blue</FONT>.
