LC Resonant Circuit
#########################

Preface
=======

This calculator helps design a resonant LC circuit for a given frequecy or wavelength.

You will need to then design a coil, using the air core coil design.
The coil design will lead to design compromise and change of inductance.

Circuit Design
==============

To compute inductance (and reactance)

1.  Enter the frequency (or wavelength)

2.Enter the maximum capacitance (in picofarads)

To determine the expected frequency response

1.  Enter an inductance

2.  Enter a capacitance
