Turns per Inch
###################

This calculator computes turns per inch for standard AWG wires.
This model is also part of the `air core coil <aircore.html>`_ design.

For turn spacing (Turns per Inch) choose
one of the following:

-   Bare Wire - Enter the guage, then double the diameter.  During assembly,
    use a length of the same size wire as a spacer between turns.

-   Enamelled Wire - Manually add 0.005" to the diameter.

-   Insulated Wire - Either measure the OD including insulation and use this,
    or wrap several turns around a ruler and measure the turns per inch.
