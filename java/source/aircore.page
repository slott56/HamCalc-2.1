Preface
=======

This calculator helps you to design a single-layer air core coil of a given inductance.
The formulae come from the <EM>ARRL Handbook for Radio Amateurs.</EM>
These formulae provide close approximations of values for
frequencies in the 1-30MHz range which are sufficiently accurate for
most amateur radio purposes.  The calculations are useful in the VHF and UHF
range by only as a basis for further calculation and experimentation.

Turns per Inch
--------------

This program designs close-wound coils.  For turn spacing (Turns per Inch) choose
one of the following:

-   Bare Wire - Enter the guage, then double the diameter.  During assembly,
    use a length of the same size wire as a spacer between turns.</LI>

-   Enamelled Wire - Manually add 0.005" to the diameter.</LI>

-   Insulated Wire - Either measure the OD including insulation and enter this
    directly, or wrap several turns around a ruler and enter the turns per inch.</LI>


In all cases, spread the winding evenly over the calculated winding length
before securing in place.

Standard Forms
--------------

Standard plastic water and drain pipe is available in the following outside
diameters:
0.66", 0.88", 1.66", 1.90", 2.38", 2.88", 3.50", 4.50"

Coil Design
===========

To calculate diameter and number of turns:

1.  Determine turns per inch.

    -   Enter AWG # for bare or enamelled wire.  Note the resistance in Ohms per inch for the wire chosen.

    -   Adjust diameter: add 0.005 for enamelled, double for bare wire.

    -   For insulated wire, wrap a form and count the turns per inch.
        Enter turns per inch directly for insulated wire.

2.  Enter the desired micro-Henries of inductance.

To calculate actual inductance for a standard sized wire form and whole number
of turns:

1.  Adjust coil diameter to a standard form.  If you will make a form, you must
    still enter a number for diameter (possibly the number given as output).

2.  Adjust the number of turns to the nearest integer

2.  Note the total length of wire.  Compute total length * ohms per inch to get the
    overall resistance of the coil.
