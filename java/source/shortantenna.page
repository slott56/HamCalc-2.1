Short Dipole Antenna

Preface
=======

This calculator helps design a dipole antenna with a lumped-constant
loading.

At modest heights (10-30 meters) it will work well if its physical length
is longer than 0.2xwavelength. This threshold length is displayed as the
"best length". Shorter lengths will be less efficient.

The antenna can be fed directly with 50 ohm coaxial cable. The design is
based on the concept of inductive loading, widely used in center loaded
mobile whip antennas.

For maximum efficiency, the antenna should be as long as possible, consistent
with available space. The loading coils should be as far from the center
feed as possible, bearing in mind that the farther the coils are from the
feed point the larger they become.

For maximum efficiency, select the longest center-to-coil length and
largest inductor that is practical for your application. To design the
required coils, see the `Air Coil Design <aircore.html>`_ calculator.

Antenna Design
==============

The following diagram illustrates the key measurements.

To compute inductance

1.  Enter the wire AWG # or diameter.

2.  Enter the desired center frequency or wavelength.

3.  Describe the antenna.

    -   Enter the available space for the dipole.

    -   Enter the distance from center to coil, which must be less than half
        the dipole's overall length.

To try different locations for the load coil.

1.  Change the center-to-coil distance, longer is more efficient.
