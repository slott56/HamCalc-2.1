555 Timer: Astable Multivibrator
################################

Preface
-------

This calculator helps design an astable multivibrator from a
standard 555 timer IC.

R1 should be 1000 Ohms or more

R2 should be 1000 Ohms or more

Total of R1+R2 should be 3.3 megOhms or less

C1 should be .0005 Microfarads or more

Frequency should be 1.0 MHz or less

Percent High Time is a function of the relationship of R1 and 2*R2.
Percent High Time must be greater than 50% and less than 100%.

Multivibrator Design

The following diagram illustrates the basic hookup.

To compute R1, R2 and C1 for a given frequency

1.  Enter the desired frequency.

2.  Enter any two of R1 (more than 1K Ohms), R2 (more than 1K Ohms)
    and/or C1 (more than 0.0005 microfarads)

#.  Click and leave the field of (R1,R2 and C1) which was computed for you.
    This will compute the duty cycle fields.

To reverse engineer a timer-based circuit to determine frequency

1.  Enter R1, R2 and C1
